## LESS files

Final CSS files are compiled from LESS counterparts. In less/src folder you will find all source files for all widgets, as well as mixing and variables. If you want to create a new theme, you can clone

- css/less/w2ui.less 

and change colors, etc. All of the variables are conveniently included into this file. Once you are done, you can compile the final file with lessc compiler.

## Do not change CSS

They will be recompiled and your changes gone. :)
